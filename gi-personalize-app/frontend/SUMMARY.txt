Now I've completed all the frontend components for your glycemic index personalization app. Here's a summary of the files I've created:
Core Application Files

App.js & App.css - Main application component with routing
index.js & index.css - Entry point and global styles
public/index.html & manifest.json - HTML template and web app manifest

Page Components

Dashboard.js & Dashboard.css - Home screen with personalization level and quick actions
FoodAnalysis.js & FoodAnalysis.css - Food photo capturing and analysis
Calibration.js & Calibration.css - Glucose response calibration process
Onboarding.js & Onboarding.css - User registration and initial profiling
Profile.js & Profile.css - User profile management
MealHistory.js & MealHistory.css - History of analyzed foods and responses

Shared Components

Header.js & Header.css - Navigation header
Footer.js & Footer.css - Page footer

Project Configuration

package.json - Dependencies and scripts

To use these files, you should organize them in the folder structure I outlined earlier:
frontend/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   └── manifest.json
└── src/
    ├── App.js
    ├── index.js
    ├── App.css
    ├── index.css
    ├── components/
    │   ├── Header.js
    │   └── Footer.js
    └── pages/
        ├── Dashboard.js
        ├── FoodAnalysis.js
        ├── Calibration.js
        ├── MealHistory.js
        ├── Onboarding.js
        └── Profile.js
This frontend code is designed to work with the backend API we created earlier. The React components make API calls to the endpoints we defined, and the UI updates based on the responses.
For your Docker setup, you can use the Dockerfile I provided previously in the deployment guide. When you build the Docker image, it will automatically compile these React components into optimized static files that will be served by Nginx.
Is there any specific part of the frontend that you'd like me to explain in more detail?
