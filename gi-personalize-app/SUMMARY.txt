Now I've completed the entire backend code structure for your glycemic index personalization app. Here's a summary of what I've created:
1. Core Application Files

app.py: Main Flask application with all API endpoints
models.py: Core ML algorithms and personalization functions
config.py: Application configuration settings
requirements.txt: Python dependencies

2. Utility Modules

utils/database.py: Functions for storing and retrieving user data
utils/food_recognition.py: Food image recognition functionality
utils/validators.py: Input validation functions
utils/init.py: Package initialization

3. Data Files

data/reference_values.json: Reference values for calibration and personalization

4. Docker Configuration

Dockerfile: Backend container configuration
docker-compose.yml: Multi-container deployment setup
nginx/nginx.conf: Nginx reverse proxy configuration

Key Features Implemented

User Management

User profile creation and updating
Storage of user preferences and health data


Food Analysis

Food image recognition (simplified mock version)
GI database lookup
Personalized GI impact calculation


Calibration System

Processing of glucose readings
Calculation of personal response factors


Personalized Learning

Tracking user responses to meals
Building personalized prediction models
Improving personalization over time


ML Integration

Leverages concepts from your uploaded ML notebook
Random Forest model for personalized predictions
Feature extraction from meal data



Deployment Structure
The backend is designed to work within a Docker container as part of a multi-container setup with the frontend and Nginx for production deployment.
To run the complete application:

Organize files according to the folder structure
Run docker-compose up -d to start all containers
Access the application at http://localhost

This backend implementation integrates directly with the frontend code I provided earlier, creating a complete full-stack application for glycemic index personalization.
